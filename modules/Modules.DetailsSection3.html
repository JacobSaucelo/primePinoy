        Migs Flores is an Entrepreneur and a Coach for Life Transformation. His
        career started when he was 19 years young as a salesman. In his first 6
        months, he had zero sales. At 21, he used to be a lonely young boy who
        thought that he's too young to make a difference. Down that he was, he
        started his journey towards personal development. His pursuit to growth
        led him to resigning from work with no Plan B and start his own path. He
        went to a one year of Apprenticeship to one of the best life coaches in
        the country and the moment he transformed, he has become a force of
        inspiration to men and women that anything they can think of is
        possible.
